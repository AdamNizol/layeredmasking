# Layered Masking
### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/layeredmasking/#/)

Layered Masking is a conceptual form of healthbar for video games which I developed using VueJs for the purposes of being used within S&Box once it releases.

The project served as an opportunity for me to become more familiar with VueJs while learning how to dynamically mask layers in a more visually interesting setting.
